# Ride2Rail Ontology for Agreements 
The objective of this ontology is to provide a conceptualization of the basic terms of the agreements modelled in the Ride2Rail Agreement Ledger Module considering the terminology and the ontologies already defined within IP4 to support interoperability through shared semantics.

The definition of an ontology to represent contracts defined through the Ride2Rail Agreement Ledger component enables the possibility of having a machine-readable and interoperable representation of the agreements. On one hand, the underlying blockchain ensures the trust about the execution of the contracts, on the other hand, their ontological representation facilitates the retrieval of information within the Shift2Rail IP4 ecosystem.

- The *Ride2Rail Ontology for Agreements* is published at [https://w3id.org/ride2rail/terms](https://w3id.org/ride2rail/terms) (preferred prefix _r2r:_)

- The *Ridesharing Booking Events* SKOS Vocabulary is published at [https://w3id.org/ride2rail/rb-events](https://w3id.org/ride2rail/rb-events) (preferred prefix _rbe:_)

- The agreements modelled for Ride2Rail are published at [https://w3id.org/ride2rail/agreements](https://w3id.org/ride2rail/agreements)

The repository is structured as follows:

- `agreements` contains the RDF representation of the **agreements modelled in Ride2Rail** to represent the contracts implemented through the Agreement Ledger Module (the ridesharing booking and the incentives)
- `docs` contains the HTML **documentation** and associated resources
- `evaluation` contains the **evaluation** reports
- `kos` contains the **SKOS vocabulary** for ridesharing events complementing the ontology
- `ontology` contains the **ontology** terms developed by Ride2Rail
- `requirements` contains the **ontological requirements specification**
